EmbeddedLinux_De1-SOC

This is a project I work on during my masterÂ´s degree.

The scope is to implement an Embedded Linux System on an FPGA. The used hardware is at first the "Terasic DE1-SoC" Board.
Later this should be adapted to the "DE10-Nano" board.

For detailed information check out the Wiki.
